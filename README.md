# INEW-2434-Midterm

This project uses Spring Boot to serve a web application that simulates a tool for my Tae Kwon Do school.

When running, the root URL returns the home page, /terminology returns the terminology page, and /students returns the table page--here, a REST api is used to perform operations on an embedded database.

I had to connect with my IP address because the browser CORS policy would not allow localhost.
