# INEW-2434-CRUD-Operations

This project uses Spring Boot to serve a web application that simulates a tool for my Tae Kwon Do school.

When running, the root URL returns the home page, /terminology returns the terminology page, and /students returns the table page--here, a REST api is used to perform operations on an embedded database.

I've made a small change since the midterm to allow CORS requests.
